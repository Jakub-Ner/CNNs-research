# CNNs-Research

This repository is dedicated to research and deepening knowledge in computer vision. It ranges from basic exercises to advanced topics in image processing and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
This project is aimed at exploring and understanding various concepts in computer vision. From basic image processing techniques to advanced CNN architectures, this repository serves as a learning and experimentation ground.

## Exercises and Topics
Basic Image Processing: Exercises on different poolings, image characteristics like contrast, filters, and blur.
Canny Edge Detection: Implementation of canny edge detection including Gaussian blurring, applying Sobel gradients, Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), double thresholding, and edge tracking by hysteresis.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Studies on activation maps, object classification using VGG, and localization techniques.
